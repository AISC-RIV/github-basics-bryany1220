I actually learned about most of this in CS100, but I'm not gonna lie I didn't retain that much information, so I think this is the perfect way to refresh my GitHub knowledge/skills.
It's been a while since I made pull requests and used Git commands, so hopefully it's not gonna be a pain like CS100 since we were doing it for a grade, not for our own personal
development.
